# How to set up

## Pre requisites

1. Git
2. A discord bot on the dev portal
3. NodeJS
4. Yarn (npm also works but I strongly encourage to use yarn instead)

## Main setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install all dependencies with `yarn`
3. Set up config by creating `src/config/options.ts` (Use `src/config/example-options.ts` as a guide) and adding all the options
4. Optional: Make sure everything is set with `yarn test`
5. Start the bot with `yarn start`
